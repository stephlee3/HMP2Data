\title{Attach dbGaP metadata to a Phyloseq object}
\usage{
attach_dbGaP(phyloseq_obj, dbGaP_repository_key = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq_obj}{A \code{\link[phyloseq]{phyloseq}}
object from the \code{\link{phyloseq}} package}

\item{dbGaP_repository_key}{A repository key downloaded from dbGaP; only
required for the initial download and not needed thereafter}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[phyloseq]{phyloseq}}
object with protected metadata from dbGaP attached
}
\description{
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of
Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) has extensive metadata pretaining to the HMP
study. Access to this metadata is controlled and its use requires
authorization by the appropriate Data Access Committee â€“ further information
is available \href{https://tinyurl.com/yb7okvga}{here}. Those with
authorization will be able to download a dbGaP repository key and can use it
to attach the controlled-access metadata to a
\code{\link[phyloseq]{phyloseq}} object with a
single command, provided the NCBI SRA Toolkit is installed and on the user's
\code{PATH}. See note below for further information.
}
\note{
The NCBI SRA Toolkit is called internally and must be on the user's
\code{PATH} or an error message will be displayed. The NCBI SRA Toolkit can
readily be installed on multiple platforms following
\href{https://tinyurl.com/y894uvvf}{these} instructions.

This attach_dbGaP function is constructed based on the same function from \href{https://github.com/waldronlab/HMP16SData}{HMP16SData} package.
