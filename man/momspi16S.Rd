\description{
The Multi-Omic Microbiome Study-Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS-PI)
was funded by the NIH Roadmap HUman Microbiome Project to
understand the impact of the vaginal microbiome
on pregnancy and the fetal microbiome. This longitudinal study
contains samples from various body sites of 596 women. This phyloseq
object contains the 16S rRNA sequencing data that was collected.
Also contained are the taxa data and participant metadata.
